    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>This document aim to list all deprecated functionality in Erlang/OTP. It
    was introduced as of OTP 22, and have not yet been updated with all old
    deprecations. Deprecations made in other parts of the documentation are of
    course still valid. For more information regarding the strategy regarding
    deprecations see the documentation of
    <seealso marker="../system_principles/misc#deprecation">Support, Compatibility,
    Deprecations, and Removal</seealso>.</p>

      <title>Crypto Old API</title>
      <p>The <seealso marker="crypto:new_api#the-old-api">Old API</seealso> is now deprecated
      and has also been
      <seealso marker="scheduled_for_removal#OTP-24">scheduled for removal</seealso>.</p>

      <title>http_uri</title>
      <p>Since OTP 21 the recommended module to handle URIs is
      <seealso marker="stdlib:uri_string">uri_string</seealso>. The module
      http_uri does not provide a implementation that satisfies the
      RFC.

      <title>pg2</title>
      <p>
	As of OTP 23, a new process group implementation
	<seealso marker="kernel:pg">pg</seealso> is introduced.
	<c>pg</c> is similar to <seealso marker="kernel:pg2">pg2</seealso>,
	but with much better scalability properties. The API and behaviour
	is however not compatible.
      </p>
      <p>
	<c>pg2</c> is now deprecated and has also been
	<seealso marker="scheduled_for_removal#OTP-24">scheduled for removal</seealso>
	in OTP 24.

      <title>VxWorks Support</title>
      <p>Some parts of OTP has had limited VxWorks support, such as for
      example <seealso marker="erl_interface:index"><c>erl_interface</c></seealso>.
      This support is now deprecated and has also been
      <seealso marker="scheduled_for_removal#OTP-23">scheduled for removal</seealso>.</p>

      <title>Legacy parts of erl_interface</title>
      <p>The old legacy <seealso marker="erl_interface:index"><c>erl_interface</c></seealso>
      library (functions with prefix <c>erl_</c>) is deprecated as of OTP 22. These
      parts of <c>erl_interface</c> has been informally deprecated
      for a very long time. You typically want to replace the usage of
      the <c>erl_interface</c> library with the use of the <c>ei</c> library
      which also is part of the <c>erl_interface</c> application. The old legacy
      <seealso marker="erl_interface:index"><c>erl_interface</c></seealso>
      library has also been <seealso marker="scheduled_for_removal#OTP-23">scheduled
      for removal</seealso>.</p>

      <title>System Events</title>
      <p>
	The format of "System Events" as defined in the man page for
	<seealso marker="stdlib:sys">sys</seealso>
	has been clarified and cleaned up.
	Due to this, code that relied on the internal badly
	documented previous (before this change) format
	of OTP's "System Events", needs to be changed.
      </p>
      <p>
	In the wake of this the function
	<seealso marker="stdlib:sys#get_debug/3">sys:get_debug/3</seealso>
	that returns data with undocumented and internal format
	(and therefore is practically useless) has been deprecated,
	and a new function
	<seealso marker="stdlib:sys#get_log/1">sys:get_log/1</seealso>
	has been added,
	that hopefully does what the deprecated function was intended for.

      <p>New time functionality and a new time API was introduced. For more information
      see the <seealso marker="erts:time_correction">Time and Time Correction</seealso>
